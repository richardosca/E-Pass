#database dependancies

#we've manually linked id numbers from different tables
#when deleting records, we will affect other tables that depend on this record
# EXAMPLE:
#     TABLE users(user_id integer, name varchar(15))
#     TABLE posts(user_id integer, name varchar(255))

#   When we delete a user who wrote a post, we have to delete all posts that belong to him/her
#   Otherwise, we'll have posts that refer to a user_id that does not exist in the users table


#REMINDER
#Deleting a security officer's acocunt can have negative consequences,
#   instead of deleting their accounts, the mgnt can just remove their
#   authority over gates
