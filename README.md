#CRUD APPLICATION
This is a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a database. The application allows users to manage data by performing CRUD operations on it. This README file provides an overview of the application's features, installation instructions, and usage guidelines.

Features
The CRUD application includes the following features:

Create: Users can create new records by providing necessary information through a user-friendly form.
Read: Users can view the existing records in a tabular format, displaying all the available data.
Update: Users can edit and update the information of existing records by modifying the fields in the form.
Delete: Users can delete specific records, removing them from the database.
Installation
To set up the CRUD application on your local machine, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
Navigate to the project directory.

Open the project files using a text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE) of your choice.

Usage
Before you can run the CRUD application, you need to set up a database. The application uses a database to store and retrieve data. Follow the instructions below to configure the database:

Create a new database using the database management system of your choice (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).

Configure the database connection parameters in the application code. Open the JavaScript file that handles the database operations and update the connection details such as the host, port, username, password, and database name.

Once you have set up the database, you can run the CRUD application using a web browser. Open the index.html file in your preferred browser, and you will be presented with the application's user interface.
